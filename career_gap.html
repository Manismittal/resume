    <h3>Career Gap from Corporate Environment</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: large;">
        The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on many aspects of life, including the corporate environment.
        For me, it resulted in a 3+ year gap in employment due to a combination of factors, including the outbreak itself,
         lockdowns, parents' health, family business instability, and the need to help my parents both at home and in 
         their business.<br><br>

During the pandemic, my parents' business was hit hard, and they needed additional support to keep it running.
 As a result, I had to take a break from my own career and focus on helping them out. This involved managing the
  day-to-day operations, dealing with clients and customs officials, and taking care of administrative tasks. At the
   same time, my parents' health was also a concern, and I needed to make sure they were getting the care and 
   attention they needed.<br><br>

Furthermore, the lockdowns and restrictions made it difficult to find new job opportunities or maintain a regular routine.
 The pandemic also had an impact on my own mental and physical health, and I needed to take the time to focus on self-care
  and well-being.<br><br>

Despite the challenges, this gap in employment allowed me to gain valuable experience and skills.
 I learned how to manage a small business, developed problem-solving and critical thinking skills,
  and gained experience in customer service and communications. Additionally, I learned how to adapt
   to changing circumstances and maintain a positive attitude in the face of adversity.<br><br>

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on my career and personal life,
 resulting in a 3+ year gap in employment. However, during this time, I gained valuable experience
  and skills that will be valuable to any future employer. I believe that this gap in employment 
  has allowed me to develop a unique perspective and skill set that can benefit any organization.
