    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a highly motivated, detail-oriented, and solutions-driven individual seeking 
        a role in project management and analysis. I have recently obtained a certification 
        from Google in both data analytics and project management, which has provided me 
        with hands-on experience in these areas. Excellent understanding of platforms for 
        effective data analysis, including SQL, spreadsheets, Tableau, and R. Strong 
        communication, organisational, and analytical skills. 

        I have over 3 years of experience in managing customs clearance business and a 
        solid understanding delivering projects from start to end. Additionally, I have
        over 2 years of experience as a web application developer, using Agile Scrum methodology with JIRA.

        I hold a graduate degree in industrial management with a specialization in 
        project management, which I earned with full scholarship. This has given 
        me a strong foundation in the principles of project management and a deep 
        understanding of how to effectively manage projects from start to finish.

        My combination of technical and business experience, combined with my drive 
        to constantly improve, makes me an ideal candidate for a role in project 
        management and analysis. I am confident that my skills, experience, and 
        passion for delivering successful projects make me an asset to any organization.</p>
